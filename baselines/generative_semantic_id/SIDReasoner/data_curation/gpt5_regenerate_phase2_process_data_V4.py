"""
Generate two-step Phase-2 user-interest traces with GPT-5.4.

V4 keeps exactly two reasoning stages:

    <history_summary>
    - <history SID> => one concise, verifiable history summary
    </history_summary>
    <future_interests>
    - [exploit or explore] <history SID> => one possible future user interest
    </future_interests>

The first stage summarizes what is present in history. The second predicts one to
four possible future interests. Exploit denotes continuation of an observed interest;
explore denotes a plausible adjacent interest. Their balance is selected dynamically.

The current ReasoningActivationDataset adds the outer ``<think>...</think>`` and
the target SID, so no Phase-2 training-loop change is required.

The generator and reviewer see the held-out target, but the target may guide only
a future interest with a natural, explicit bridge from history. When no such bridge
exists, the target is ignored and the history-grounded trace is retained.

Production input comes from ``yufan/recsys-genrec-dataset-refresh-gpt5.4-candidateV1``:

    <Category>_reasoning / train
    <Category>_catalog / train

The V3 production contract is retained for source columns, ``reasoning_path``,
resume-safe JSONL, and CSV filenames. V4-specific auxiliary columns use the new
``history_summary`` and ``future_interests`` names.

Examples:

    # Show one real HF prompt without calling GPT
    python gpt5_regenerate_phase2_process_data_V4.py \
        --category Video_Games --limit 1 --dry-run

    # Generate a 20-row pilot
    python gpt5_regenerate_phase2_process_data_V4.py \
        --category Video_Games --limit 20

    # Full production run
    python gpt5_regenerate_phase2_process_data_V4.py \
        --category Video_Games --out-dir ./regen_phase2_process_V4

Outputs are resume-safe and updated after every completed inference:

GENERATOR_PROMPT = """Given the chronological user history (oldest to newest) and held-out
target below, write a concise two-stage user-interest trace.

HISTORY:
{history_block}

HELD-OUT TARGET (visible to the teacher; never identify it in the output):
{target_block}

Use this structure:
{output_format}

Requirements:
1. <history_summary> contains 1-3 concise observations grounded only in cited HISTORY
    metadata. Summarize repeated patterns, important attributes, and recent transitions.
    State only what the cited items and metadata explicitly establish. Do not infer or mention
    user interest, preference, intent, likelihood, recommendation, or future behavior. Do not
    use predictive language such as may, might, likely, suggests, or appears. TARGET must not
    influence this block.
2. <future_interests> contains 2-4 genuinely different possible future user interests derived
    from HISTORY. Replace [MODE] with exactly [exploit] or [explore]. Include at least one of
    each mode. Beyond that minimum, choose the number of lines and label balance dynamically
    from the evidence.
3. Assign each mode by direct instantiation:
     - [exploit]: the predicted interest is already directly instantiated by at least one
         HISTORY item; the prediction continues or narrows it.
     - [explore]: the predicted interest is not directly instantiated in HISTORY and is reached
         through one explicit shared attribute. Be bold: use a distinctive mechanic, theme,
         fantasy, skill, social pattern, or use case to infer a genuinely new neighboring
         interest, including across genres or product types when the bridge is strong.
     Prefer a non-obvious but defensible transfer over generic "other items" on the same
     platform. Platform or brand alone is not a sufficient bridge. Do not chain multiple
     speculative transitions.
4. Scale predictions to evidence: usually 1-2 future interests for one history item, 1-3 for
    two or three items, and 2-4 for four to ten items when genuinely distinct. Even with a
    short history, make the required explore meaningful by expanding from the most distinctive
    observed attribute rather than from a generic platform or product category.
5. Every future-interest line must describe what the user may be interested in and state the
    shared theme, mechanic, use case, or attribute linking it to the cited HISTORY item(s).
    An explore line must name both the explicit bridge and the genuinely new interest reached
    through it. The prediction may move one bold semantic step beyond the cited evidence, but
    no farther. Do not tell a recommender what to recommend, prioritize, serve, offer, or test.
6. TARGET may guide at most one future interest only when the bridge attribute is independently
    explicit in HISTORY and the prediction remains plausible if TARGET is hidden. TARGET may
    help select a novel direction reached through that bridge, but platform or brand overlap
    alone is insufficient. If the bridge is weak, ignore TARGET. Never cite the target SID,
    reveal item titles or identifying names, or predict an exact next item.
7. Every line must begin with one or more exact full SIDs copied verbatim from HISTORY,
    followed by "=>" after any mode label. Separate multiple SIDs with commas. Never use
    positions, aliases, or abbreviated SIDs. HISTORY records interactions only; never claim
    purchase, ownership, possession, or investment. Keep each line to one main claim in one
    sentence. Output only <history_summary> and <future_interests>."""

    "and each prediction may make one bold but defensible semantic transfer through an "
    "explicit history bridge. Exploration should be genuinely new rather than generic "
    "same-platform or same-brand continuation. Require at least one exploit and one explore, "
    "without enforcing a fixed ratio "
    "for any additional lines. Remove recommendation-action, purchase, and ownership language; "

HISTORY:

CANDIDATE:

VALIDATION ISSUE:
{validation_issue}

For an accepted row, use exactly this format:
{output_format}

Audit and repair these conditions:
1. Use 1-3 concise history-summary lines grounded only in cited HISTORY metadata. Summarize
    patterns, attributes, or recent transitions. Remove user interest, preference, intent,
    likelihood, recommendation, and future-behavior inference, including may, might, likely,
    suggests, or appears. TARGET must not influence this block.
2. Use 2-4 distinct future interests. Replace [MODE] with exactly [exploit] or [explore].
    Include at least one of each mode. Beyond that minimum, choose the number and balance
    dynamically from the evidence.
3. Reclassify every line using direct instantiation:
     - [exploit]: the predicted interest is already directly instantiated by at least one
         HISTORY item; the prediction continues or narrows it.
     - [explore]: the predicted interest is not directly instantiated in HISTORY and is reached
         through one explicit shared attribute. Make it bold but defensible by transferring a
         distinctive mechanic, theme, fantasy, skill, social pattern, or use case into a genuinely
         new neighboring interest, including across genres or product types when justified.
     Reject generic "other items" based only on platform or brand. Remove chained, random, or
     unsupported broadening.
4. Scale predictions to evidence: usually 1-2 future interests for one history item, 1-3 for
    two or three items, and 2-4 for four to ten items when genuinely distinct. For short
    histories, derive explore from the most distinctive observed attribute, not a generic
    platform or product category.
5. Make each future interest state its history bridge and describe what the user may be
    interested in. Every explore must name both its explicit bridge and its genuinely new
    destination. Allow one bold semantic step beyond the cited evidence. Remove instructions
    to recommend, prioritize, serve, offer, or test items. TARGET may guide at most one novel
    direction only when the bridge attribute is explicit in HISTORY and the direction remains
    plausible with TARGET hidden. Ignore it when the bridge is weak.
6. Every line must begin with exact full HISTORY SIDs, followed by "=>" after any mode label.
    Separate multiple SIDs with commas. Replace positions, aliases, or abbreviated SIDs.
7. Keep each line to one claim. Do not reveal item names or TARGET, cite the target SID,
    predict an exact item, claim purchase or ownership, or return another block. Always return
    nonempty <history_summary> and <future_interests> blocks."""
