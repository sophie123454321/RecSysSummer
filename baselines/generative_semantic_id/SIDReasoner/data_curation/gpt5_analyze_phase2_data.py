"""
Audit SIDReasoner Phase-2 reasoning-activation training data with GPT-5.6-sol.

WHAT IT DOES
  Loads Video_Games_reasoning from yufan/recsys-genrec-dataset together with the
  matching catalog. For every training row it evaluates:

    * how predictable the target is from the user history;
        * whether the reasoning hallucinates unsupported preferences or attributes;
        * whether it is logically consistent and aligned with the target interest;
        * whether low-predictability targets cause strained target-overfit reasoning;
        * aggregate failure insights and guidance for rewriting the full dataset.

    Deterministic checks run before the LLM judge for exact SID/title leakage,
    missing reasoning, and encoding corruption.
  The judge receives those checks as evidence but independently audits semantics.

HOW TO RUN
  Prereq: run `az login`; gpt5_endpoint_test.py supplies Azure clients.

    # Pilot a sample before paying for the full audit.
    python gpt5_analyze_phase2_data.py --limit 200 --shuffle

    # Audit the full Video_Games domain, 8 processes per endpoint.
    python gpt5_analyze_phase2_data.py

    # Use selected endpoints.
    python gpt5_analyze_phase2_data.py --per-endpoint 12 \
        --endpoints feedscopilot-azureopenai-au feedscopilot-azureopenai-sweden

RESUME
  Results are appended immediately. Re-running the same command skips rows whose
  category, user/history, target, and reasoning content have already been audited.
  Failed rows are not written and are retried on the next run.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a meticulous recommender-systems data auditor. You are judging ONE training row for a SID-based model's Phase-2 reasoning-activation SFT.

TRAINING TASK. At inference time the model sees only chronological history SIDs. It must produce a target-blind reasoning trace inside <think>...</think>, followed by the next-item SID. The audited `reasoning_path` was generated offline with the target available only as hidden guidance. It was required to reason from history, refer to items only by SID, avoid naming or predicting a specific next item, avoid mentioning the reference/target, and end with calibrated likely interests.

YOUR CENTRAL JOB. Separate these two questions:
1. TARGET PREDICTABILITY: How strongly does history alone support the held-out target?
2. REASONING QUALITY: Would the reasoning still be justified if the target were hidden?

Do not reward a trace merely because it resembles the target. A trace that precisely selects an unpredictable target interest may exhibit hindsight bias or privileged-target leakage. Conversely, a target can be noisy while a broad, honest trace remains useful supervision.

GROUNDING RULES.
- Judge item semantics from titles and descriptions. SIDs are opaque identity codes; shared SID prefixes are not semantic evidence.
- Use only the supplied history and catalog text. Never invent product attributes, user demographics, sentiment, purchases, or motivations.
- Distinguish an observed interaction from inferred preference. One interaction is weak evidence unless its semantics are unusually specific.
- Recency, repetition, coherent transitions, series/brand continuity, and functional complementarity are valid evidence when explicitly present.
- A statement is unsupported if no supplied history item supports it, even if it happens to match the target.
- Exact target title/SID/reference mention is explicit leakage. Semantic overfitting to a weakly predictable target can be strong leakage even without a literal mention.
- The deterministic checks are evidence, not authoritative semantic labels. Correct them when context proves them misleading.

METHOD. Work internally in four passes, then return only JSON.
PASS 1: Infer the history-supported interests without using the target.
PASS 2: Reveal the target; identify its interest, supporting/contradicting history evidence, plausible alternatives, and predictability.
PASS 3: Audit every reasoning claim for hallucination and audit the full trace for logical consistency and target-interest alignment.
PASS 4: Especially when target_predictability <= 2, decide whether the trace honestly reflects uncertainty or strains/backfits the history toward the target, then extract lessons for rewriting the data.

RUBRIC.

[A. TARGET INSIGHT]
target_relation (single closest relation):
  repeat = target is identical or nearly identical to history.
  same_subcategory = same fine-grained type/genre/use case.
  same_brand_or_series = explicit brand, franchise, series, sequel, or edition continuity.
  complementary = a different item with a direct functional relationship.
  broadening = a new sub-interest inside a supported broad domain.
  exploration = no meaningful history-supported relation.
target_predictability (1-5):
  5 = history nearly determines this target (repeat, obvious next installment/refill/accessory).
  4 = strong natural continuation with specific recent or repeated evidence.
  3 = supported broad interest, but many alternatives are equally plausible.
  2 = weak or indirect connection; substantial guesswork is required.
  1 = essentially unpredictable from history.

[B. PROCESS-REWARD SIGNALS]
hallucination_severity (1-5, HIGHER IS WORSE):
    1 = every material item/user-preference claim is supported by supplied history.
    2 = one minor extrapolation that does not drive the conclusion.
    3 = several weak inferences or one unsupported claim that affects the conclusion.
    4 = major unsupported preferences/attributes drive the recommendation direction.
    5 = the trace is largely fabricated, contradicts evidence, or appears derived from privileged target information.
target_interest_alignment (1-5, descriptive rather than automatically good):
    1 = reasoning interest is unrelated to the target.
    2 = only a weak broad-domain overlap.
    3 = same broad interest but not the target's meaningful sub-interest.
    4 = identifies the correct target sub-interest/use case.
    5 = closely matches the target's specific interest/continuation.
logical_consistency (1-5, HIGHER IS BETTER):
    1 = central claims/conclusion contradict each other or the chronology.
    2 = major logical jump or contradiction.
    3 = understandable but contains a weak transition or unsupported leap.
    4 = coherent with only a minor gap.
    5 = each conclusion follows consistently from stated history evidence.
target_overfit_risk (1-5, HIGHER IS WORSE):
    1 = reasoning direction follows from history independently of the target.
    2 = mostly history-driven with mild target-compatible selectivity.
    3 = suspiciously selects one weakly supported direction among many alternatives.
    4 = strains/cherry-picks history to match a low-predictability target.
    5 = explicit target leakage or clear backward construction from the target.
training_harm_risk (1-5, HIGHER IS WORSE):
    1 = safe process supervision.
    2 = minor noise unlikely to teach a bad reasoning pattern.
    3 = mixed supervision requiring revision before use.
    4 = likely teaches hallucination, inconsistency, or target-overfit shortcuts.
    5 = strongly harmful supervision or an essentially unlearnable target/history pair.

[C. DIAGNOSTIC SYNTHESIS]
dominant_failure_mode: one of none, target_noise, insufficient_history, hallucination, logical_inconsistency, target_misalignment, target_overfit, or malformed_reasoning.
rewrite_guidance: a concrete lesson for regenerating this kind of reasoning without hallucination, inconsistency, or target backfitting. Focus on the new data-generation policy, not whether to retain this row.

CONSISTENCY RULES.
- High target_interest_alignment is not inherently good. When target_predictability <= 2, alignment >= 4 requires explicit history evidence; otherwise target_overfit_risk must be >= 4.
- Any material unsupported claim must raise hallucination_severity. Unsupported target-specific claims must also raise target_overfit_risk.
- hallucination_severity >= 4 or logical_consistency <= 2 implies training_harm_risk >= 4.
- When the history/target pair itself is weak, use target_noise or insufficient_history as dominant_failure_mode; otherwise diagnose the reasoning defect.
