# SIDReasoner — Reasoning over Semantic IDs for Generative Recommendation

Official implementation of **"Reasoning over Semantic IDs Enhances Generative
Recommendation"** ([arXiv:2603.23183](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.23183)).

SIDReasoner teaches a generative recommender to **think in natural language over
Semantic IDs (SIDs)** before it recommends. A single Qwen3-1.7B backbone is
aligned so that a compact `<a_i><b_j><c_k>` SID and its underlying item
semantics become interchangeable — the model can read an interaction history in
SID space, reason about the user's intent in plain language, and then decode the
next item as a valid SID. Data streams straight from the Hub; there is no local
dataset to prepare.

> **TL;DR recipe.** Qwen3-1.7B backbone · 3-token RK-Means SIDs · **three
> stages**: (1) SID↔language *alignment SFT* over 8 complementary tasks →
> (2) *reasoning activation* SFT on interleaved SID-text narratives →
> (3) *GRPO RL* with a rule-based recommendation reward. Evaluate in
> **thinking mode**: vLLM drafts the reasoning trace, then constrained beam
> search (beam 10) decodes a catalog-valid SID.

## Highlights

- **Reasoning that ends in a valid item.** The model produces a free-form
  `<think>…</think>` trace, then decodes an SID under a prefix trie so every
  recommendation is guaranteed to exist in the catalog.
- **Alignment-first.** Stage 1 mixes 8 tasks that tie SIDs to titles and text in
  both directions, so reasoning has real semantics to work with.
- **Academic-scale.** Everything runs on a single 4–8 GPU node with a 1.7B model
  and public Amazon-2023 categories.
- **Zero data prep.** All splits, item catalogs and RL prompts load from
  [`yufan/recsys-genrec-dataset`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yufan/recsys-genrec-dataset)
  through one helper, [`hf_data.py`](hf_data.py).

## How it works

Three training stages produce one model; evaluation is two-pass.

**Stage 1 — SID ↔ language alignment (SFT).** Eight complementary tasks are
concatenated so the model learns to translate freely between SIDs, titles and
descriptions, and to do sequence recommendation in every representation:

| # | Task (input → output) | What it teaches |
|--:|---|---|
| 1 | SID history → next SID | recommendation in SID space |
| 2 | Title ↔ SID (both directions) | bidirectional item translation |
| 3 | SID history → next Title | fusion sequence recommendation |
| 4 | Title history → next Title | text-only sequence recommendation |
| 5 | Title history → next SID | cross-representation recommendation |
| 6 | Item narrative with SIDs | item-level SID-text interleaving |
| 7 | User-sequence narrative with SIDs | sequence-level SID-text interleaving |
| 8 | General reasoning | preserve base reasoning ability |

**Stage 2 — reasoning activation (SFT).** Fine-tune on interleaved
SID-and-text narratives so the model starts *explaining* a recommendation before
emitting it, producing coherent `<think>` traces grounded in SID semantics.

**Stage 3 — reinforcement learning (GRPO).** Optimize the reasoning policy with
[VERL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) using a **rule-based recommendation
reward** that scores whether the reasoned-out SID matches the ground-truth next
item. Output is an FSDP checkpoint; merge it into an HF model (`actor_merged`).

**Recommendation evaluation.** Every phase uses the same vLLM fixed-depth
decoder for training-time and offline HR/NDCG. Both modes rank catalog SIDs by
the sum of exactly three semantic-token log-probabilities; newline and EOS
probabilities never enter the ranking:

1. **Thinking mode:** vLLM greedily drafts the reasoning trace
  (`temperature=0`), truncated at `</think>`.
2. **No-thinking mode:** the prompt supplies an empty `<think></think>` span.
3. The **same vLLM engine** runs fixed-depth **beam search (beam 10)** over a
  trie of all catalog SIDs. Training and evaluation share the implementation
  in `verl/workers/rollout/sid_constrained_decoding.py`.

## Quickstart

### Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# All recommendation evaluation and Stage 3 need a CUDA-matched vLLM/VERL stack:
bash scripts/install_vllm_sglang_mcore.sh
```

> **Note.** vLLM 0.8.5 is built for `torch 2.6.0+cu124` (pre-CXX11 ABI). If
> `import vllm` fails with an `undefined symbol … parseSchemaOrName …` error,
> your Torch is ABI-mismatched — reinstall the matched wheel:
> `pip install "torch==2.6.0" "torchvision==0.21.0" "torchaudio==2.6.0" --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124`.

### Categories

Three Amazon-2023 categories are supported out of the box — set `CATEGORY` at the
top of any stage/eval script:

`Video_Games` · `Office_Products` · `Industrial_and_Scientific`

---

## Data (from the Hub)

All training and evaluation data loads **at runtime** from
[`yufan/recsys-genrec-dataset`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yufan/recsys-genrec-dataset)
via [`hf_data.py`](hf_data.py) — no manual download, no `./data/Amazon` folder.

The file paths that remain in the scripts are only **locators**: `hf_data.py`
parses the category (and split) out of them and maps to the right HF config, so
you never have to change a shell argument.

| Legacy file (locator) | Hugging Face config |
| --- | --- |
| `train/valid/test/<cat>_5_*.csv` | `<cat>_seqrec` |
| `index/<cat>.item.json`, `index/<cat>.index.json`, `index/<cat>.item_enhanced_v2.json`, `info/<cat>_5_*.txt` | `<cat>_catalog` |
| `index/<cat>.integrated_narrative.csv` | `<cat>_reasoning` |
| `rec_reasoning_verl/<cat>/*.parquet` | `<cat>_rl` |
| `general/sampled_data.arrow` | `general_reasoning` |

## Training

Run the three stages in order. Each writes logs to `./logs` and checkpoints to
`./output_dir` (Stages 1–2) or `./checkpoints` (Stage 3).

```bash
# Stage 1 — SID ↔ language alignment SFT      (4 GPUs, Qwen3-1.7B)
bash phase1_alignment_sft/sft_Qwen3_enrich.sh

# Stage 2 — reasoning activation SFT          (resumes from Stage 1)
bash phase2_reasoning_activation/sft_reasoning_activation.sh

# Stage 3 — GRPO RL via VERL                  (resumes from Stage 2)
bash phase3_rl/RL_training_script.sh          # verl 0.6.0 (torch2.8 + vllm0.10.2)
```

| Stage | Objective | Backbone / resume | Default hardware |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Alignment SFT (8 tasks) | `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B` | 4× GPU, `torchrun` |
| 2 | Reasoning activation SFT | Stage-1 `final_checkpoint` | 4× GPU, `torchrun` |
| 3 | GRPO RL (rule-based reward) | Stage-2 `final_checkpoint` | 4× GPU, VERL |

### Stage-1 throughput / memory

Measured on Stage-1 alignment SFT (Qwen3-1.7B, bf16, ZeRO-2). `GC` = gradient
checkpointing; `bs` = per-GPU micro-batch. Peak memory is per-GPU; throughput is
global (tokens/s across the run).

| Config | Peak memory | Per step | Global tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| GC off, bs4 | 70.6 GiB | 5377 ms | 10,922 |
| GC on, bs4  | 32.5 GiB | 5583 ms | 10,519 |
| GC on, bs8  | 58.4 GiB | 7457 ms | 19,720 |

- **Gradient checkpointing is nearly free.** At `bs4` it cuts peak memory by more
  than half (70.6 → 32.5 GiB) for only ~4% slower steps (~4% lower tok/s).
- **Spend the freed memory on batch size.** With GC on, `bs8` fits in 58.4 GiB
  (< 80 GB) and nearly doubles throughput (10.5k → 19.7k tok/s) despite longer
  steps — so **GC on + bs8** is the throughput-optimal setting on an 80 GB GPU.

### Merge a Stage-3 checkpoint

Thinking-mode evaluation expects a merged HF checkpoint named `actor_merged`.
If RL produced raw FSDP `actor/` shards, merge them first:

```bash
python3 ./phase3_rl/merge_fsdp_checkpoint.py \
  --checkpoint ./output_dir/<run>/global_step_<N>/actor \
  --output-dir ./output_dir/<run>/global_step_<N>/actor_merged
```

---

## Evaluation

```bash
# Thinking mode — vLLM reasoning trace + constrained beam-search SID decoding
bash evaluation/evaluate_Qwen3_think.sh

# Non-thinking mode — vLLM fixed-depth constrained SID decoding
bash evaluation/evaluate_Qwen3.sh
```

Each script splits the test set across the listed GPUs, generates in parallel,
merges the shards, and reports **NDCG@{1,3,5,10}** and **HR@{1,3,5,10}**.
Results land in `./results/<run>/`.

Each evaluator limits its OpenMP, MKL, OpenBLAS, and NumExpr pools to one CPU
thread before importing vLLM. This prevents eight parallel EngineCore processes
from oversubscribing the host and starving the GPUs. Set
`SIDR_EVAL_CPU_THREADS=<N>` only when intentionally tuning for a different
process/GPU topology.

The tested defaults use batch size 32 for thinking and 96 for no-thinking.
With beam width 10, no-thinking expands to at most 960 requests per SID step;
larger batches can trigger a pinned-buffer sizing failure in vLLM 0.10.2.

### Our reproduction

Reproduced with the released per-domain Stage-3 checkpoints (`actor_merged`),
**thinking mode**, full test set, `num_beams=10`, `max_new_tokens=1024`,
`temperature=0` (greedy, deterministic). Every decoded SID was catalog-valid
(0 invalid generations). Because a single item is held out per user, **HR@K equals
Recall@K**, so these numbers are directly comparable to the paper's Table 2 above —
and the reproduction closely matches the reported SIDReasoner results.

### Phase-3 decoding and reward ablation (Video Games)

The following partial results compare how the Stage-3 training decoder and its
reward signal affect final recommendation quality. All runs use GRPO with 16
rollouts per prompt and the same thinking-mode, catalog-constrained beam-10
evaluation protocol. `M` is the pointwise three-level SID match score
(`0`, `0.25`, `0.5`, or `1.0`), `V` indicates a catalog-valid SID, `D(r) =
1/log2(r + 1)` discounts a beam match at rank `r`, and `m` is the target SID
log-probability margin over the lowest-scoring beam-10 candidate.

| Variant | Training SID decoder | Candidates per trajectory | Catalog-constrained training | Reward family | Effective training reward | Validity bonus | Credit scope | Recall@10 | Delta Recall@10 | NDCG@10 | Delta NDCG@10 |
|---|---|---:|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | Standard sampled decoding | 1 | No | Prefix matching + validity | `M + 0.1V` | `+0.1` | Generated SID | 0.0897 | reference | 0.0497 | reference |
| Constrained greedy search | Trie-constrained greedy | 1 | Yes | Pointwise SID matching | `M` | None | Top-1 valid path | 0.0926 | +0.0029 | 0.0546 | +0.0049 |
| Constrained beam search (EM) | Trie-constrained beam, width 10 | Up to 10 | Yes | Exact-match beam reward | `D(r_exact)` if the exact SID is in the beam; otherwise `0` | None | Exact-match rank in the full beam | **0.0988** | **+0.0091** | **0.0560** | **+0.0063** |
| Constrained beam search (prefix) | Trie-constrained beam, width 10 | Up to 10 | Yes | Hierarchical prefix reward | Exact: `D(r3)`; else prefix-2: `0.2D(r2)`; else prefix-1: `0.05D(r1)`; else `0` | None | Best matched hierarchy level in the full beam | 0.0964 | +0.0067 | 0.0549 | +0.0052 |
| Constrained beam search (margin) | Trie-constrained beam, width 10 | Up to 10 | Yes | Exact match + margin fallback | Exact: `D(r_exact)`; miss: `0.2 exp(min(0, m))` | None | Exact-match rank or target-vs-threshold log-probability margin | 0.0871 | -0.0026 | 0.0505 | +0.0008 |

The constrained beam EM variant is currently the strongest configuration,
improving Recall@10 by 0.0091 (10.1% relative) and NDCG@10 by 0.0063 (12.7%
relative) over the baseline. Prefix shaping ranks second, but its denser partial
credit does not outperform the exact-match beam signal in these runs. The
margin fallback produces a small NDCG gain but lower Recall@10 than the
baseline, indicating a recall-ranking trade-off. Constrained greedy decoding
also improves both metrics, showing that catalog-valid training-time decoding
is useful even without a beam. Because each row changes both the decoder and
the reward interface, these numbers should be read as a system ablation rather
than an isolated causal comparison of reward functions.
