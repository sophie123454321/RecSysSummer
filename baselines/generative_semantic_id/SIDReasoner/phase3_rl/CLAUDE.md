# CLAUDE.md — SIDReasoner

Guidance for Claude when working in this repository.

## Model initialization checkpoint

The Stage-2 (reasoning-activation) checkpoint to **initialize / resume Stage-3 RL from**:

```
/yufan/checkpoint_backup/Video_Games_stage2_reasoning_activation_Qwen3-1.7B/final_checkpoint
```

- Backbone: **Qwen3-1.7B**, domain: **Video_Games**.
- This is the `actor_rollout_ref.model.path` for GRPO RL.

## Start Stage-3 RL training

The default launcher is
[`RL_training_script_no_kl.sh`](RL_training_script_no_kl.sh). It runs Stage-3 GRPO
without reference-policy KL regularization on **verl 0.6.0** (`verl` is a top-level
package dir at the repo root; launch is the standard
`python -m verl.trainer.main_ppo`).

[`RL_training_script.sh`](RL_training_script.sh) retains the original KL-regularized
configuration for reproduction and ablation only; do not use it as the default.

Launch it from the **repo root** with the model path above. **Always launch with
`nohup … &`** so the long RL run survives SSH disconnects / terminal hangups (the
script already writes its own training log via `> "${log_file}" 2>&1`):

```bash
mkdir -p logs   # nohup's redirect target must exist before launch
nohup bash phase3_rl/RL_training_script_no_kl.sh \
    actor_rollout_ref.model.path=/yufan/checkpoint_backup/Video_Games_stage2_reasoning_activation_Qwen3-1.7B/final_checkpoint \
    > logs/phase3_launch.out 2>&1 &
```

The script forwards trailing args (`"$@"`) to `python -m verl.trainer.main_ppo`,
and Hydra applies last-wins overrides, so the `model.path` above overrides the
script's default checkpoint.

## Default algorithm choice: No-KL

Use **No-KL GRPO** for Stage-3 by default. The launcher explicitly sets both KL
switches to false:

```text
actor_rollout_ref.actor.use_kl_loss=False
algorithm.use_kl_in_reward=False
```

With both switches disabled, verl does not register a `RefPolicy` worker, does not
compute reference-policy log probabilities, does not add KL to the actor loss, and
passes the custom rule-based reward directly into GRPO advantage estimation.

### Outcome-only reward

This branch is the constrained-sampling exact-match baseline. Each training
trajectory samples one catalog-valid three-token SID after its reasoning. The
custom reward returns `1` only when that sampled SID exactly matches the target
and `0` otherwise. Standard prompt-group GRPO normalizes this outcome reward and
broadcasts the resulting advantage across the sampled reasoning and SID actions.

For a controlled comparison with the process-reward branch, the reward function
also computes and logs strict V4 format, history-summary grounding,
future-interests grounding, history-reference coverage, their aggregate process
score, and process active-group rate. These are diagnostics only: they stay in
`reward_extra_info` and never enter `compute_advantage`, the policy loss, or the
training `score`.

Observed final recommendation results:

| Variant | Office_Products NDCG@10 / R@10 | Video_Games NDCG@10 / R@10 | Industrial_and_Scientific NDCG@10 / R@10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **No-KL** | **0.1132 / 0.1572** | 0.0481 / 0.0957 | **0.1050 / 0.1498** |
| KL | 0.1121 / 0.1562 | **0.0492 / 0.0965** | 0.1039 / 0.1480 |

Across the three domains, No-KL wins 4 of 6 reported metrics. Its macro averages are
0.08877 NDCG@10 and 0.13423 R@10, compared with 0.08840 and 0.13357 for KL. These
single-run differences support treating recommendation quality as **comparable, with
a small average advantage for No-KL**, rather than claiming statistical significance.
No-KL also reduced measured training time by approximately **30%**. Therefore, No-KL
is the default because it preserves performance while materially improving training
efficiency; use the KL script only when an experiment specifically requires that
ablation.

### Domain: Video_Games (script default)

The script **defaults to the `Video_Games` domain end‑to‑end** — data, reward, and the
**wandb run name** all match the Games checkpoint above. Concretely the script sets
`trainer.experiment_name=Video_Games_stage3_rl_constrained_sid_sampling_em_outcome_only_no_kl_Qwen3-1.7B`
(this is the wandb run
name, under project `SIDReasoner_Phase3_MetricsV2`), `data.*=.../Video_Games/*.parquet`, and
`custom_reward_function.path=.../direct_recommendation_StepRule_Games.py`. So the
launch command above is all you need — you do **not** have to override data / reward /
wandb.

To run a **different** domain, override its four knobs **and keep the wandb run name in
sync** so the experiment is labeled by its real domain, e.g. for Office_Products:

```bash
nohup bash phase3_rl/RL_training_script_no_kl.sh \
    actor_rollout_ref.model.path=./output_dir/Office_Products_stage2_reasoning_activation_Qwen3-1.7B/final_checkpoint \
  trainer.experiment_name=Office_Products_stage3_rl_no_kl_Qwen3-1.7B \
    data.train_files=./data/Amazon/rec_reasoning_verl/Office_Products/train.parquet \
    data.val_files=./data/Amazon/rec_reasoning_verl/Office_Products/test.parquet \
    custom_reward_function.path=./verl/utils/reward_score/direct_recommendation_StepRule_Office.py \
    > logs/phase3_launch.out 2>&1 &
```

(The Games reward reads `./data/Amazon_Games/info/Video_Games_5_2016-10-2018-11.txt`,
resolved relative to the repo root — the RL script `cd`s there.)

## Data source (Hugging Face, NOT local) — HF config & column map

Like Phase‑1/2, **all Phase‑3 data comes from `yufan/recsys-genrec-dataset`, never from
local disk.** But Phase‑3 has **two data stages**, so the provenance has two halves:

1. **Offline materialization** — [`create_reasoning_rl_data.py`](create_reasoning_rl_data.py)
   pulls from HF (`hf_data.load_df(...)`) and writes verl parquet
   (`./data/Amazon/rec_reasoning_verl/<domain>/{train,test}.parquet`).
2. **RL training** — `RL_training_script_no_kl.sh` feeds those parquet to verl GRPO;
  the **reward function** then scores rollouts online, itself reading one more HF
  config.

The `./data/...` strings are just locators / output targets, **not** tracked local data —
run the materialization once per domain before launching RL; do not hand‑edit local files.

### A · Materialization → which HF config / columns feed the parquet

`Reasoning_RL_Dataset` builds each `(prompt, ground‑truth)` pair from:

| verl split | HF config | Column(s) actually used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `train.parquet` | `<cat>_reasoning` (train) | `history_item_sid`, `item_sid` |
| `test.parquet` | `<cat>_seqrec` (test) | `history_item_sid`, `item_sid` |

- The **train locator** is `{cat}.integrated_narrative.csv` → `load_df` routes it to the
  `<cat>_reasoning` config; the **test locator** sits under `test/` → `<cat>_seqrec` (test).
- **RL reads only `history_item_sid` + `item_sid`.** Unlike Phase‑2 it does **not** read
  `reasoning_path` / `integrated_narrative` — GRPO makes the model generate its *own*
  reasoning, so no teacher trace is kept; only the target SID becomes the ground truth.
- **Catalog is loaded but not consumed** (same trap as Phase‑2): `Reasoning_RL_Dataset`
  also loads `<cat>_catalog` (`item.json` + `index.json`) into a `sid2title` map, but
  `pre()` never uses it — the prompt is the SID history, the ground truth is the raw
  `item_sid`.

### B · verl parquet schema (what RL actually trains on)

`convert_to_verl_format` writes one row per sample:

| Column | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `prompt` | chat `messages` = system instruction + "user interacted with {SID history}…" |
| `reward_model.ground_truth` | the target `item_sid` (raw 3‑token SID string) |
| `data_source` · `ability` · `extra_info` | routing / bookkeeping (split, index, echoed Q/A) |

### C · Constrained SID rollout and reward

The vLLM rollout worker loads the selected domain's catalog and builds a token-level
**SID prefix trie**:

| Loads | HF config | Column(s) used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hf_data.load_sid_indices(sid_category)` | `<cat>_catalog` (train) | `sid_tokens` |

- Each of the 16 GRPO rollouts samples one reasoning, discards the sampled suffix after
  `</think>`, then samples one three-token SID path. At each position, `allowed_token_ids`
  contains only catalog-valid continuations, so the sampled SID is a real catalog path.
- Training reward is exact match only. Standard prompt-level GRPO compares the 16 complete
  `reasoning + SID` trajectories and broadcasts each trajectory's advantage to both spans.
- SID old/new log probabilities are normalized over the trie-allowed actions, so all three
  sampled SID tokens contribute actor gradients. The normalized separator and EOS remain
  outside the actor loss.
- Validation remains deterministic reasoning followed by catalog-constrained beam-10 and logs
  HR/NDCG@1/3/5/10, so the final evaluator is unchanged.

## Environment

- Build/run with [`../Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile): verl 0.6 base image
  (CUDA 12.8, torch 2.8.0, flash-attn 2.7.4) + **vllm 0.10.2** + deepspeed + fire.
- Requires GPUs (Stage-3 RL uses vLLM rollout + FSDP).
- `verl` (repo root) — v0.6.0 trainer (active, top-level package dir).

## Repo layout quick reference

Paths below are relative to the **repo root** (this file lives one level down in
`phase3_rl/`).

- `phase1_alignment_sft/`, `phase2_reasoning_activation/` — Stage 1/2 SFT (DeepSpeed).
- `phase3_rl/` — Stage 3 GRPO RL on **verl 0.6.0** (this directory).
- `evaluation/` — inference + metrics.
